# Tip-Calc

Tip calculator built from a shell provided by the above Udemy course built by Angela Yu. Happy with it in it's current state other than one piece, I've yet to figure out how to dismiss the keypad when the user touches anywhere on the screen, not just one of the other button options. 

I tried my best to organize the methods and files in a way that most closely aligns to MVC, but I've definitely got a lot to learn.
